<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>This GitHub repository encapsulates a streamlined data preparation project conducted in Google Colab. Focused on the <a href="Bitter.csv">"Bitter" dataset</a>, the project systematically transforms raw data into a refined state, meticulously tailored for machine learning applications. From binary transformations to feature selection and visualization, each step is intricately designed to distill meaningful insights. The repository includes the <a href="data_prep_BitterDB.ipynb">notebook with the script</a>, code snippets, visualizations, and exported datasets (<a href="raw_prepared_dataframe.xlsx">raw_prepared_dataframe</a> and <a href="normalized_dataframe.xlsx">normalized_dataframe</a>).</p>
